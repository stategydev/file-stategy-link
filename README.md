### Stand-alone Installation

Required tools:

cd file-stategy-link

# Checkout the latest version
git fetch --tags && git checkout $(git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`)

# Start the backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run build
pm2 start --name="pingvin-share-backend" npm -- run prod

### Integrations

#### ClamAV (Docker only)

ClamAV is used to scan shares for malicious files and remove them if found.

1. Add the ClamAV container to the Docker Compose stack (see `docker-compose.yml`) and start the container.
2. Docker will wait for ClamAV to start before starting Stategy Share. This may take a minute or two.
3. The Stategy Share logs should now log "ClamAV is active"

Please note that ClamAV needs a lot of [ressources](https://docs.clamav.net/manual/Installing/Docker.html#memory-ram-requirements).

### Additional resources

### Upgrade to a new version

As Stategy Share is in early stage, see the release notes for breaking changes before upgrading.

#### Docker

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

#### Stand-alone

1. Remove the running app
   ```
   pm2 delete pingvin-share-backend pingvin-share-frontend
   ```
2. Repeat the steps from the [installation guide](#stand-alone-installation) except the `git clone` step.

### Custom branding
